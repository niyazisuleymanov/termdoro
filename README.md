  Start a countdown to or from TIME. Example values for TIME:

  and count forward.

  Hotkeys:
      L       Lap (stopwatch mode only)
      R       Reset
      SPACE   Pause (will delay absolute TIME)
      +       Plus (will add 10 seconds)

                                second annunciations starting at --critical;
